InmobiNativeAdBanner
====================
Native ads are gaining popularity as they allow the developer to integrate ads more seamlessly into their app, leading to more clicks, and higher revenue.

But native ads cannot currently be mediated, so low fill rates can lead to a waste of inventory. 

In this Android project, we demonstrate how to show a banner-like native ad using Inmobi, falling back to Admob in case of no fill.
